# Custom Command Nightbot
These custom commands are purely for fun. The custom command is ideas from other friends of mine and was coded by me.


### You need to know
______
- Commands are being used publicly so you don't have the right to claim to others that you made it and need to remove it in their channel.
- You need to know how to use [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) because most of the commands we are gonna do need a long code.
- Before using the commands I made please make sure that you know what is going on in the codes.


## [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/)
So before we get started these are all the things you need to do in Pastebin.
Login into Pastebin then you need to create a folder first so that it is easier for you to see the codes you did.
I prefer putting the Paste Settings like this.<br><br>

All you gonna do is just name your Pastebin.

For anybody who is complaining saying the command or the link of the Pastebin is not working this is the right link for the Pastebin.<br>
Press the `raw` button in your made Pastebin. <br><br>

Then copy the link it will be like this `https://pastebin.com/raw/########`<br><br><br>

Don't ever copy other people's Pastebin links because if the owner of that Pastebin link knows that you are using the link they can change the code in there and make your nightbot have lots of errors or they can make spam commands.

## Custom Commands
In each folder is a custom command. They have different instructions so please read most of them.<br><br>

> If you all have suggestions or ideas on some commands I'll try to make them. I won't make promises that I will make it because I am not good at coding in nightbot. <br>
> If you do have a question you can ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShinukiAyatoVT) if I am available tho.
