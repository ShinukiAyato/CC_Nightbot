# Custom Command Nightbot
These custom commands are purely for fun. The custom command is ideas from other friends of mine and was coded by me.


### You need to know
______
- Commands are being used publicly so you don't have the right to claim to others that you made it and need to remove it in their channel.
- You need to know how to use [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/).
- Before using the commands I made please make sure that you know what is going on in the codes.


## [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/)
So before we get started these are all the things you need to do in Pastebin.
Login into Pastebin then you need to create a folder first so that it is easier for you to see the codes you did. In each command, it will say what you need to put in the Pastebin settings.
